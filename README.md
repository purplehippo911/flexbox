### What I learned
I learned how to align multiple items using CSS Grid. 

### Continued development
I am planning on making my own little website. I will also try to get more comfortable with grid and try to recap on my JS with challenges from [frontend mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) 

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an extra resource which has a downloadable cheatsheet for grid, which is good for recap.
